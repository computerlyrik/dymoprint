# On systems with access to sysfs under /sys, this script will use the three
# variables DEV_CLASS, DEV_VENDOR, and DEV_PRODUCT to find the device file
# under /dev automatically. This behavior can be overridden by setting the
# variable DEV_NODE to the device file path. This is intended for cases, where
# either sysfs is unavailable or unusable by this script for some reason.
# Please beware that DEV_NODE must be set to None when not used, else you will
# be bitten by the NameError exception.
