For more information about experimental device support, see [#44](https://github.com/computerlyrik/dymoprint/issues/44).

## Installation

It is recommended to install Labelle with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) so that it runs in an isolated virtual environment:

```bash
pipx install labelle
```

In case pipx is not already installed, it can be installed on Ubuntu/Debian with

```bash
sudo apt-get install pipx
```

or on Arch with

```bash
sudo pacman -S python-pipx
```

By default, users don't have permission to access generic USB devices, so you will
need to add a rule. The first time you run `labelle`, it will give instructions
about how to do this:

```bash
$ labelle "Hello world"
...
You do not have sufficient access to the device. You probably want to add the a udev rule in /etc/udev/rules.d with the following command:

  echo 'ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0922", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1001", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/91-labelle-1001.rules
...
```

## Testing experimental features

To install a test branch, by GitHub user `ghuser` for the branch `branchname`, run

```bash
pipx install --force git+https://github.com/ghuser/labelle@branchname
```

To revert back to the release version, run

```bash
pipx install --force labelle
```

To install a particular release version, specify `labelle==x.y.z` in place of `labelle` in the above command.

## Development

To install for development, fork and clone this repository, and run (ideally within a venv):

```bash
pip install --editable .
```

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run some checks before committing.
After installing the `pre-commit` executable, please run

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Font management

Fonts are managed via [labelle.ini](labelle.ini). This should be placed in your
config folder (normally `~/.config`). An example file is provided here.

You may choose any TTF Font you like

You may edit the file to point to your favorite font.

For my Arch-Linux System, fonts are located at e.g.

```bash
/usr/share/fonts/TTF/DejaVuSerif.ttf
```

It is also possible to Download a font from
<http://font.ubuntu.com/> and use it.

## Modes

### Print text

```labelle MyText```

Multilines will be generated on whitespace

```labelle MyLine MySecondLine # Will print two Lines```

If you want whitespaces just enclose in " "

```labelle "prints a single line"```

### Print QRCodes and Barcodes

```labelle --help```

### Print Codes and Text

Just add a text after your qr or barcode text

```labelle -qr "QR Content" "Cleartext printed"```

### Picture printing

Any picture with JPEG standard may be printed. Beware it will be downsized to tape.

```labelle -p mypic.jpg ""```

Take care of the trailing "" - you may enter text here which gets printed in front of the image
